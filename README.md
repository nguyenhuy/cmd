`cmd` is an agentic AI assistant for the work you do in Xcode. It helps you plan, handles routine tasks and answers your questions so that you can focus on the most **valuable** and **creative** parts of your work.

## AI, in Xcode

`cmd` integrates in your existing workflows with Xcode. Not need for another IDE. `⌘`+`I` brings the assistant, `⌘`+`␛` backgrounds it.
