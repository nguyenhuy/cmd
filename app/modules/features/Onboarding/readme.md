# Onboarding

A few screens to guide the user through the initial setup.

Required steps:
- grant accessibility permission
- set up at least one LLM provider

Optional steps:
- grant Xcode extension permission

For debugging purposes, the onboarding flow can be triggered again by selecting the corresponding setting in the internal settings. Be sure to first reset your permissions, remove LLM provider configurations, and to re-launch Xcode (so that the Xcode extension process is terminated).
