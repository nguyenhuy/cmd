// MARK: - LocalServer

/// A class that communicates with the local server running in the host app.
///
/// As the extension is loaded by Xcode when it launches and will be disable if its code changes while Xcode is running,
/// it is hard to work with the extension when iterating on its code - usually in Debug mode.
/// To mitigate this issue, there is an internal setting that makes the Debug app communicate with the Release app's extension.
/// This is allows to iterate on the Debug app and still have a stable extension to communicate to and is a good workflow unless you are actively developping the extension itself.

  /// Sends a command to the local server and returns the response.
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - command: The command to send to the local server.
  ///   - input: The input to send to the local server.
  ///   - Returns: The decoded response from the local server.
