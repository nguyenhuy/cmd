## Overview

After configuring your [AI providers](/pages/ai-providers), you need to enable which models you want to use. cmd provides fine-grained control over:

- Which models are available in the model selector
- Which provider to use when a model is available from multiple sources
- Default model preferences

You can configure models during onboarding or anytime through **Settings > Models** or **Settings > AI Providers**.

## Enabling Models

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Model Settings">
    Go to **Settings > Models**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Browse Available Models">
    You'll see all models available from your configured providers
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Models">
    Toggle on the models you want to use. Enabled models will appear in the model selector when using cmd.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Preferences">
    If a model is available from multiple providers, select your preferred provider
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  You need at least one provider configured before you can enable models. See [AI Providers](/pages/ai-providers) to set up providers.

## Managing Multiple Providers for the Same Model

Some models may be available from multiple providers. For example:
- **Claude Sonnet** from both Anthropic and OpenRouter
- **GPT-4** from both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI
- Popular models from both direct providers and aggregators

### Setting Provider Preference

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Model Settings">
    Navigate to **Settings > Models**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find the Model">
    Locate the model that's available from multiple providers
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Provider">
    Choose which provider to use from the dropdown:
    - Anthropic
    - OpenRouter
    - OpenAI
    - etc.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Your preference is saved automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  You might choose different providers based on:
  - **Cost**: Compare pricing across providers
  - **Speed**: Some providers may have faster response times
  - **Reliability**: Use a backup provider if your primary is having issues
  - **Features**: Some providers offer additional features
</Tip>

## Switching Models During Use

Once you've enabled models, you can switch between them easily in the chat interface:

1. Click the **model selector** at the top of the chat
2. Choose from your enabled models
3. Continue your conversation with the new model

The model selector shows only the models you've enabled in settings.

<Warning>After changing model mid-conversation, the next message will not have a cached prompt</Warning>
