</AccordionGroup>

## Step 3: Configure AI Providers

cmd requires at least one AI provider to function. You'll configure this during the onboarding flow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a Provider">
    Select from supported providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, or others
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter API Key">
    Provide your API key from the chosen provider
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Connection">
    cmd will verify your configuration works
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Models">
    Choose which models you want to use
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Card>

<Info>
  Your API keys are stored securely in macOS Keychain. cmd never sends your code to its own serversâ€”only to your chosen AI provider.
</Info>

## Step 4: Configure Xcode 26 (Optional)

If you're using Xcode 26, you can integrate cmd with Xcode's built-in AI chat interface.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Xcode Settings">
    In Xcode, go to **Xcode > Settings > Intelligence**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Model Provider">
    Click **"Add a Model Provider"**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Local Model">
    Select a local model running on port **10101**:

  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Either Interface">
    You can now interact with cmd through:
    - **Xcode's AI chat**: Built into Xcode 26
    - **cmd's sidebar**: The native cmd interface

    <img src="/assets/xcode26-sidebar.jpeg" alt="Using cmd in Xcode 26" />
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  The Xcode 26 integration gives you flexibility to use whichever interface you prefer while benefiting from cmd's powerful agentic AI.
</Tip>

## Privacy & Security

  **Your code stays on your machine**

  - cmd runs entirely locally
  - Your code is only sent to your chosen AI providers
  - You can opt out of anonymized analytics
  - API keys are stored in macOS Keychain
