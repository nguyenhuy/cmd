description: "Configure AI providers to use with cmd"

## Overview

cmd connects to AI providers using your API keys. You can configure multiple providers and switch between them as needed. This gives you flexibility to:

- Use different providers for different tasks
- Have backup options if one provider has issues
- Compare performance across providers
- Take advantage of different pricing models

## Initial Setup

During the onboarding flow, you'll be prompted to configure at least one AI provider. You can always add more providers later through **Settings > AI Providers**.


## Adding a Provider

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open AI Providers Settings">
    Go to **Settings > AI Providers**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add New Provider">
    Configure the desired provider (typically with an API key)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Select which of the available models to enable
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  API keys are stored securely in your macOS Keychain and are never sent to cmd's servers.

## Managing Providers


### Setting a Default Provider

When multiple providers offer the same model, you can set which provider to use by default. See [Models](/pages/models) for details.
