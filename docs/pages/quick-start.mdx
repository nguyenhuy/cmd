## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- macOS (cmd is a native macOS application)
- Xcode installed on your system
- An API key from at least one supported AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install cmd">
    Choose one of the following methods:

    **Using Homebrew (recommended):**
    ```bash
    brew install cmd
    ```

    **Or download the DMG:**

    Download the [latest release](https://github.com/getcmd-dev/cmd/releases/latest) and drag cmd to your Applications folder.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch cmd">
    Open the cmd app from your Applications folder or Launchpad.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Grant Accessibility Permission">
    cmd needs accessibility permission to see what's in Xcode and make edits.

    When prompted:
    1. Click "Open System Settings"
    2. Enable cmd in Privacy & Security > Accessibility
    3. Return to cmd
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure AI Provider">
    During the initial setup, you'll need to configure at least one AI provider:

    1. Choose your preferred AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
    2. Enter your API key
    3. Select your preferred model

    <Note>
      cmd never sends your code to any server other than your chosen AI provider. Your API keys are stored securely in your macOS keychain.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Your First Task

Once setup is complete, let's try cmd:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a Project in Xcode">
    Open any Xcode project or create a new one.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open cmd Sidebar">
    The cmd sidebar should appear automatically. If not, you can open it from the cmd menu bar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask cmd to Help">
    Try asking cmd to help with something simple:

    - "Explain what this function does"
    - "Add comments to this code"
    - "Create a simple test for this class"

    <img src="/assets/sidebar.png" alt="cmd sidebar" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Accept Changes">
    cmd will show you what it plans to change before making modifications. You can:
    - Review the proposed changes
    - Accept or reject them
    - Ask cmd to make adjustments
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Optional: Xcode 26 Integration

If you're using Xcode 26, you can integrate cmd with Xcode's built-in AI chat:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Xcode Settings">
    Go to `Xcode > Settings > Intelligence > Add a Model Provider`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Local Model">
    Select a local model running on port **10101**

    <img src="/assets/xcode26-installation-prompt.jpeg" alt="Xcode 26 setup" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Either Interface">
    You can now interact with cmd using:
    - Xcode 26's built-in AI chat interface
    - cmd's own sidebar UI

  </Step>
</Steps>
