## Overview

While cmd's agent mode can autonomously take on complex tasks, you might prefer to bring in an external agent.<br/>
Setting up Claude Code gives you access to powerful agentic capabilities through cmd's native interface in Xcode.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring Claude Code in cmd, you need to have Claude Code installed and set up on your system.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Claude Code">
    Follow [the official setup guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup) to install Claude Code.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Installation">
    Ensure Claude Code is working properly by running it from your terminal:

    ```bash
    claude --version
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Login in Claude Code">
    Launch Claude Code in your terminal to authenticate (either with an API key or an Anthropic subscription)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring Claude Code in cmd

Once Claude Code is installed and configured, you can enable it in cmd:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open AI Provider Settings">
    Go to **Settings > AI Providers** in cmd
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configuration">
    cmd should **automatically detect** where Claude Code is installed on your system.

    Otherwise, or if you need specific launch arguments, you can manually specify how to launch Claude Code

    1. Click **"Add Provider"** or **"Configure"** for Claude Code
    2. Provide the path to the Claude Code binary
    3. Optionally, specify a custom command if you use a specific way to run Claude Code

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Example: Using mise">
        If you run Claude Code via `mise`, you can specify:

        ```bash
        mise x npm:@anthropic-ai/claude-code@latest -- claude code
        ```
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Example: Direct binary path">
        If you have Claude Code installed in a specific location:

        ```bash
        /usr/local/bin/claude
        ```
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Example: npm global install">
        If installed via npm globally:

        ```bash
        npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code
        ```
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Claude Code">

## Using Claude Code

Once enabled, Claude Code will appear in your model selection:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Claude Code">
    In the cmd interface, open the model selector and choose **"Claude Code"**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Using">
    You can now use Claude Code's advanced agentic capabilities:
    - Multi-step task execution
    - Integrates with your existing Claude Code configuration, include `CLAUDE.md`
    - Rich native UI in cmd
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Claude Code appears in the model selector just like any other AI model, but as an external agent it provides advanced capabilities that go beyond simple chat interactions.
